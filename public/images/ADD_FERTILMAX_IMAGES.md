# How to Add Fertil Max Images

## Required Image Files

You need to add 2 image files to this folder (`public/images/`):

1. **fertilmax-box-side.webp** - The box side panel image
2. **fertilmax-supplement-facts.webp** - The supplement facts label image

## Steps to Add Images:

1. **Save the images you showed me:**
   - Right-click on the box side panel image → Save As → Name it `fertilmax-box-side.webp`
   - Right-click on the supplement facts image → Save As → Name it `fertilmax-supplement-facts.webp`

2. **Place them in this folder:**
   ```
   C:\Users\DELL\Desktop\hamosa-medical2\public\images\
   ```

3. **After adding the files, commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add public/images/fertilmax-box-side.webp public/images/fertilmax-supplement-facts.webp
   git commit -m "Add Fertil Max additional product images"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Vercel will automatically deploy** and the images will appear on your website!
